### About Project

- This project is completely based on creating a visualized dashboard for sales.
- this dataset includes records such as Date, Name of salesperson, Region, Products, Unit sold, Unit price, Cost of goods, Total Sales, and Profits.
- I had created two different dashboards.
- In the First Dashboard that shows **Salesperson and total sales done by Date/Year**
- The second Dashboard shows the **Total Sales by Product, Total Sales by Sales Person, Units Sold by Products, Total Sales by Region, Average Sales, and Profit Gains etc..,**

- During this project, I learned how visualized data is useful in real-time (we can analyze data and effectively make decisions).
- I also learned Important concepts in Excel like pivot tables, customized chart creations, and some of the Excel formulas used to complete the work more efficiently.
